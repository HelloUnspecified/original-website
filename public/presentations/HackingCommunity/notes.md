# Intent / Purpose

The overall goal here is to give people the tips and tricks to really take advantage fo the community around them.

Showing up is the big first step but what else can really be done to take max advantage.

# What community is vs what it isn't.

not twitter.
not speaking.

it is people.

# The "Network" or perceived network.

Numbers, followers
True Influence
Reach
Reputation
Brand Perception

Social today.
what's really going on.

Actually taking action. just cause there are 1k followers. How many are really activated.

# Overall Tips.

-   Things happen in the DM - Period.
-   Understand the rhythm and tasks of a conference.
-   Understand what value, service, you can provide. No matter what you can offer something.
-   Do not waste peoples time.
-   offer potential solutions, not complaints. Offer to help fix problem being part of the resolution.
-   Time and resources. ( money is just a resource )
-   to many people ask, not give.
-   be an advocate, and affiliate.
-   Toxic people, cancers.

Don't pretend to know it all. By not knowing, you're vurnable and you have an opportunity to have a conversation.
if you're asking for help be mindful of someone's time. have specific things you need where someone can help without having to consume the whole deal.

If you understand my overall vision for THAT Conference then you can really crawl into why we make some of the decisions we do.

# Organizers / Vanguards

They are the most invested. Many have contracts may even be in millions of dollars. Financial pressures are very real.

Time and patience.
transparency

By the time the event happens, I'm already mentally crushed. My problems are much different at the event than before the event.

# Speakers / Contributors

Why to people speak?

-   Good will.
-   It's a personal teaching opportunity.
-   Ego.
-   Personal or Company Branding.
-   Reach throughout the community.
-   Consulting, Jobs, Credibility

Looking to speak?

Company -> User Group -> Code Camp -> Regional Conference -> National Event -> International Event

-   Have some kind of profile. If you're a ghost, why would you get selected? It doesn't matter your community just be reachable in some way.
-   What is your brand? Who are you?
-   Reach out to the organizer asking what their theme is.
-   Ask them, what content would they really like.
-   What is their overall mission, what's hard for them and see if there is a place you might be able to fill in.
-   Odds of getting selected.

-   Offer your resources.

If Selected:

-   Ask the organizers if there are other speakers that might complement your talk. Maybe suggest partnering or introducing you to them.
-   Help their social game. It might seem silly to retweet something but their very interested in your success as well.
-   Offer to connect to sponsors. Introductions go a long way.
-   Read what you're given. Understand there are three other legs to that stool. you're just one piece.
-   Say thank you!
-   use your entire time.

*   Respect the position the organizers are in and their time.

# Sponsors / Supporters

There is always motive, but is more than ok. They are exchanging money for opportunity. Those who don't have motive won't come, but will support in other ways.

Typically sponsors are looking for one or all of the following:

-   Recruiting
-   Branding
-   Sales

Regardless, how can you use the sponsors in unique ways?

# Attendees / Members

Why go? Why are you here? What do you hope to get out of it?

Is it really for education?
or is it about the people? Peoples experiences?

Have you done your homework? If the organizer seems themselves as the connector, then what would you like to be connected too?

-   Offer to find sponsors.
-   Offer

Tips on how to navigate a conference / event / meetup:

-   work an area. want to meet everyone, offer to work the registration, checkin.
-   sit a a new table.
-   shake hands, make it easy to exchange contact information.
-   Be authentic
-   be a connector.

Shake hands.
Where are the organizers, hanging.
How can you scale at a conference.

Scheduling tools. You can schedule a lot of tweets etc.
Reach out before hand to folks.

# Networking

-   Deep Relationships
-   Tim Ferris - Social Stamp of approval. Ask people for help getting to people of similar interest. Doesn't have to be the organizer. It could be the moderator of a panel.

    Go Narrow... Go Long.

Use your time to build lasting relationships.

Be authentic. Be You, Do You.

Jab Jab Jab Right Hook.
Ask Last, provide first.
